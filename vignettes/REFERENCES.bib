abstract = {Summary In this study, we present a new analytical model to predict water influx from finite bottomwaterdrive aquifers (BWDAs). The new model can be used for aquifer representation in reservoir simulators and material-balance analysis. The new model is computationally fast. The model has been verified against the results from the Coats (1962) and Allard and Chen (1988) models. Using the new model, we compare the cumulative water influx from bottomwaterdrive (BWD) and edgewaterdrive (EWD) aquifers. In the second part, we couple the new aquifer model with the material-balance equation (MBE) and demonstrate its use in reserves estimate. Production data from a BWD oil reservoir simulated by Allard and Chen (1988) is analyzed. We conducted a McEwen analysis (1962) to predict the reserves. Introduction Hydrocarbon reservoirs may be classified on the basis of their drive mechanisms. In the reservoirs adjoined by water aquifers, waterdrive may be the primary production mechanism. In these reservoirs, production of hydrocarbons causes a pressure drop in the hydrocarbon/water interface. Because of this pressure drop, the aquifer reacts by encroaching into the reservoir and filling its pore spaces. The invasion of reservoir rock by aquifer water may have a significant impact on reservoir performance. Therefore, water influx into hydrocarbon reservoirs must be predicted accurately as a function of time, pressure history at the reservoir/aquifer interface, reservoir/aquifer size ratio, and aquifer characteristics. To forecast the performance in a waterdrive reservoir, an aquifer model simulating the fluid flow in the aquifer and flow from the aquifer into the reservoir is needed. Aquifer models may be classified on the basis of flow regimes and flow geometries. In terms of flow regimes, aquifers may be grouped as pot model, steady-state models, pseudosteady-state models, and unsteady-state models. On the basis of flow geometry, the aquifer/reservoir systems may be categorized as zero-dimensional, linear, and radial. The aquifer models considering radial-flow geometry may additionally be sorted as EWD or BWD. Aquifer models are commonly used in two different reservoir-engineering applications, reserves estimation and reservoir simulation. The main functionality of aquifer models is to predict cumulative water influx in material-balance computations. Along these lines, the Allard and Chen (1988) model, among others, has been incorporated into commercial software. In the large-scale simulation studies, the number of gridblocks may be reduced to have reasonable computation time and expense. Typically, in such large-scale simulation cases, the aquifer is represented implicitly by use of an analytical model. In commercial reservoir simulators, several analytical models are available for implicit representation of aquifers.},

abstract = {Introduction Linear aquifers, either limited or essentially infinite, may be encountered in reservoir engineering practice. In areas where faulting fixes reservoir boundaries, the fault block reservoir may have an aquifer of limited extent whose geometry is best approximated as linear. An infinite linear aquifer can occur as a regional feature whenever water movement through the aquifer member is constrained to one direction. Such constraints can arise from major faults. facies changes or pinchout of the member. Miller* pointed out that linear aquifers have received only meager attention in the past. He analyzed the performance of finite and infinite aquifers, developed working equations and curves, and presented examples. While Miller's curves may be used fairly easily, a separate one is required for each size of aquifer. In this paper, Miller's equations have been used as a starting point. By modifying them slightly, they can be reduced to a form which yields a single a working curve, applicable to any size of aquifer. Thus, interpolation between curves is eliminated and accuracy is improved. Miller's results for finite aquifers covered only the boundary condition of no flow across the outer aquifer boundary. This paper also includes the case of constant pressure at the outer aquifer boundary. DEVELOPMENT OF EQUATIONS FOR LINEAR AQUIFERS Miller's equations give pressure drop or cumulative influx at the linear aquifer-reservoir boundary as a function of time for the boundary conditions of an infinite aquifer and a finite aquifer with sealed outer boundary. In addition to these equations, those appropriate for the boundary condition of a finite aquifer with constant pressure at the outer boundary have been developed. The approach used in developing these equations was the same as that used by Miller. BOUNDARY CONDITION 1: CONSTANT RATE OF INFLUX ACROSS AQUIFER-RESERVOIR BOUNDARY Infinite Linear Aquifer (1) Finite Linear Aquifer, Constant Pressure at Outer Boundary (2) BOUNDARY CONDITION 2: CONSTANT PRESSURE AT AQUIFER-RESERVOIR BOUNDARY Infinite Linear Aquifer (4) Finite Linear Aquifer, Sealed Outer Boundary (5) Finite Linear Aquifer, Constant Pressure at Outer Boundary (6) These equations are usually put in a form where dimensionless time is defined by (7) Here, x is a reference distance and is usually taken to be a unit distance. However, the choice is really arbitrary, as long as consistency is maintained. We choose x = L ; then (8) For finite aquifers, L is the length of aquifer; for infinite cases, it may be considered as an arbitrarily chosen length. The reason for this choice will be clear later when the performances of finite and infinite aquifers are compared. JPT P. 561{\^{}}},

abstract = {This approach to water influx calculations offers a useful and flexible method of forecasting and analyzing the performance of water drive reservoirs. The separation of the water influx problem into a rate equation and a material balance equation, not requiring superposition, makes the concepts and calculations quite simple and easy to apply. IntroductionAll gas and oil reservoirs are associated to varying extents with formation waters. The inclusion of the effects of expansion or invasion of this water into oil and gas reservoirs has taken many forms, from recognizing the effects of the expansion of the connote water within the gas or oil reservoir itself, to calculating water influx or efflux across a boundary (with the boundary usually being that of an oil or gas reservoir). There are four currently popular methods used for calculating water influx into reservoirs. They are: 1. Schilthuis, steady state 2. Hurst Simplified, unsteady state 3. Resistance or Influence Function, unsteady state 4. van Everdingen-Hurst Radial, unsteady state The first three methods have proved useful for predicting water drive performance after sufficient predicting water drive performance after sufficient historical data have been obtained to fix the necessary influx constants. With what some consider to be disappointing results, the van Everdingen-Hurst Radial method is often used with geological and core data when little or no performance history is available. It has also been used to predict reservoir performance after enough historical data have been accumulated to develop values of the influx constants, tD and C. In an attempt to include geometries other than radial, derivations for both limited and infinite systems have been made to cover linear spherical, elliptical, thick-sand, and wedge-shaped reservoir-aquifer models. The many rigorous geometrical representations that have been developed cannot readily handle the effect of interference between reservoirs. Electric analyzer studies of the Smackover Limestone aquifer in Arkansas by Bruce, of the Woodbine aquifer in East Texas by Rumble et al., and of the Ellenberger in West Texas by Moore and Truby have shown that reservoirs sharing a common aquifer can severely interfere with each other, and that, for individual reservoirs in a common aquifer, water drive performance calculations that do not consider interference performance calculations that do not consider interference can be greatly in error. Mortada developed a mathematical method with which to handle interference in a basically infinite radial aquifer system. The method has been applied to field cases. Coats concluded from his own study that, "In predicting the pressure-volume behavior of gas reservoirs situated on the common aquifer the effect of interference from other reservoirs on the common aquifer must be accounted for." Another aquifer problem more recently presented in the literature is that of flank water injection for pressure maintenance, either to initiate or to pressure maintenance, either to initiate or to supplement edge-water influx. A case history shows that we need to be able to study the effects of injecting water into the aquifer instead of merely including it in the hydrocarbon material balance equation. JPT P. 814},

abstract = {AbstractFor several years the authors have felt the need for a source from whichreservoir engineers could obtain fundamental theory and data on the flow offluids through permeable media in the unsteady state. The data on the unsteadystate flow are composed of solutions of the equation(Equation).Two sets of solutions of this equation are developed, namely, for "theconstant terminal pressure case" and "the constant terminal ratecase." In the constant terminal pressure case the pressure at the terminalboundary is lowered by unity at zero time, kept constant thereafter, and thecumulative amount of fluid flowing across the boundary is computed, as afunction of the time. In the constant terminal rate case a unit rate ofproduction is made to flow across the terminal boundary (from time zero onward)and the ensuing pressure drop is computed as a function of the time.Considerable effort has been made to compile complete tables from which curvescan be constructed for the constant terminal pressure and constant terminalrate cases, both for finite and infinite reservoirs. These curves can beemployed to reproduce the effect of any pressure or rate history encountered inpractice.Most of the information is obtained by the help of the Laplacetransformations, which proved to be extremely helpful for analyzing theproblems encountered in fluid flow. The application of this method simplifiesthe more tedious mathematical analyses employed in the past. With the help ofLaplace transformations some original developments were obtained (andpresented) which could not have been easily foreseen by the earliermethods.IntroductionThis paper represents a compilation of the work done over the past few yearson the flow of fluid in porous media. It concerns itself primarily with thetransient conditions prevailing in oil reservoirs during the time they areproduced. The study is limited to conditions where the flow of fluid obeys thediffusivity equation. Multiple-phase fluid flow has not been considered.T.P. 2732},
